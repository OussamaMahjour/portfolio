        <p>
Hey! Iâ€™m Oussama Mahjour, a curious and self-driven developer who loves building things with code. I studied math and computer science at the Faculty of Sciences in Rabat, and since then, Iâ€™ve been exploring everything from web apps to microservices and cloud tools.

Right now, Iâ€™m into building full-stack apps using React on the frontend and Spring Boot on the backend. I like working on challenging projects that push me to learn new stuffâ€”whether it's playing with Docker containers, diving into distributed systems, or setting up custom dev environments.

When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m probably tweaking my terminal setup, reading tech blogs, or figuring out how things work under the hood. Always excited to learn, improve, and build cool stuff with others.
